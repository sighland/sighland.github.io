        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Systems programming is, at a basic level, the programming of dynamic computer systems. What does this mean? Well, it helps to consider the definitions <br>
            ... by definitions. So: "programming" means coding. Dynamic means "actively changing"; i.e. we are working in the realm where we are actively recieving and <br>
            writing data between computational units. "System" just refers to the fact that what we are coding is part of a network of items -- for example, an operating <br>
            system is a network of operations. <br>
            <br>
            On the Hardware - Software spectrum, this would count as software, but about one step removed from hardware. <br>

        <h1>Abbreviations</h1> <br>
        <p>
            Perhaps the only thing I can speak to regarding systems programming is the amount of vague abbreviations. <br>
            Here, I intend to provide a list of as many as possible. <br>
