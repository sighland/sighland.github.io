            <abbr title="Central Provessing Unit">CPU</abbr> which is also called a central processor.
            The fundamental purpose of a CPU is to execute a sequence of stored instructions -- what we call the "program". This is an executable file.
            In modern systems architecture, each PROCESS is isolated, sot ehre is a translation process (TRANSLATION LOOKASIDE BUFFER)
            between the address of a CPU instruction or a piece of data of a process and the actual byte of PHYSICAL MEMORY (RAM).
