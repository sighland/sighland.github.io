            The magnetic force induced by a solenoid on a magnetic object inside it will cause all the dipole moments in the object to align in same direction. <br>
            For paramagnetic objects, this is in direction of B field. <br>
            For diamagnetic objects, this is opposite it. <br>
            Either way, putting a magnetic material in a solenoid? That's an <a href="circuits/inductors.html">inductor</a>! <br>
            The magnetic force of a charge is 0 if the direction of motion is the same as the direction of the magnetic field <br>
            <br>

            Brief note on the connectivity of the subject matter: <br>
            Systems programming is incredibly useful for the digital modeling and producing simulation, which in turn is useful for 
            modeling various classical mechanic and electrodynamic phenomenae. Electronic Circuitry is important as it allows for the importing
            of physical data into a digital format, which can then be used by a computer system to produce the models!
