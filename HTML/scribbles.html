            The magnetic force induced by a solenoid on a magnetic object inside it will cause all the dipole moments in the object to align in same direction. <br>
            For paramagnetic objects, this is in direction of B field. <br>
            For diamagnetic objects, this is opposite it. <br>
            Either way, putting a magnetic material in a solenoid? That's an <a href="circuits/inductors.html">inductor</a>! <br>
            The magnetic force of a charge is 0 if the direction of motion is the same as the direction of the magnetic field <br>
