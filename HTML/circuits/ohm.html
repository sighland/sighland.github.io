            <h1>Ohm's Law</h1>
            <p>
                Ohm's law, in it's basic form, says the <a href="#voltage">voltage</a> (or, electric potential difference) across a component is equivalent to the <a href="#current">current</a> through the component
                times the resistance value of the component. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content" id="voltage">
            <h1>Voltage</h1>
            <p>
                Units: Volt [ML<sup>2</sup>T<sup>-3</sup>I<sup>-1</sup>] <br> <br>
                All components experience an electric potential, which can be thought of as the amount of stored electrical energy. Fundamentally, a component
                is a wire connected to something that alters the electric flows, connected to another wire. This means that there is a different potential at
                either wire, since the electricity is altered as it flows across the component. The measure of this difference in electric potential is referred
                to as "voltage".

        <div class="content" id="current">
            <h1>Current</h1>   
            <p>
                Units: Ampere [I] <br> <br>
                Current can be thought of as an electric analog to velocity -- it is the rate of flow of electric charge.
