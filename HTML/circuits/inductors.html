                An inductor is essentially a coil of wire (similar to a solenoid) wound around a core material (which can be air, ferrite, or other magnetic materials). When current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field around the coil, just like in a solenoid. <br>

                When a magnetic material (such as iron) is inserted into the core of the inductor, it enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil. This happens because the magnetic material increases the magnetic permeability of the core, allowing more magnetic flux to pass through it for a given current. As a result, the inductance of the coil increases, which strengthens the ability of the inductor to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. <br>

                (Note a parallel with how the capacitor stores energy in an electric field) <br>

                Inductors are used for energy storage, filtering, and controlling the flow of AC signals. By controlling the properties of the core material and the number of turns in the coil, the behavior of inductors can be tailored to suit specific application requirements<br>
