                Anode and cathode are terms from the days of vacuum tubes where cathode referred to the electrode that emitted electrons <br>
                and anode referred to the electrode that accepted them. For a pn junction, both electrons and holes are carrying current. However, <br>
                the p-side is somewhat like the anode in a vacuum tube diode so the terminology lives on.  <br>
