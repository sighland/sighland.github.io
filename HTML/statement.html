                Knowledge is often made inaccessible. There are several reasons for this. One is the hyper-specialization of terminology.
                Another is the paywalling of educational materials by for-profit corporations. Another is the disorganization of knowledge.
                <br>
                For-profit institutions such as Universities succeed in teaching material to students by providing a <i>knowledge structure</i> in
                the form of textbooks and syllabi. Wouldn't it be great if there was a sort of "guiding hand" to learning that didn't cost hundreds
                of thousands of dollars? This is what I hope to achieve with this site. My aim is to map out concepts that are often presented
                abstractly or independently from each other, and to show the reader the connection between the two. Just as well, I hope to present a
                sort of "syllabus" for each relevant topic I have listed here -- that is, I would like to map each subject from its core foundations to
                its advanced implementations in a way that is coherent and accessible to the reader.
